allow inline comments.

normalize spacing (or rely on tidy?).

grammar rules
-------------
- one line maximum for titles.

handle # that has whitespace before it at the beginning of a line.

a comment only line is thought of as a blank line, not a missing line.

make sure *everything* can be backslash quoted, including {} in code blocks.

make sidebarblock etc better name.

make infinite loop protection.

learn proper difference between span and div.

do at least some replacements in code - things like dashes, ampersands etc,
that are required for html.
