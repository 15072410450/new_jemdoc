allow inline comments.

normalize spacing (or rely on tidy?).

grammar rules
-------------
- one line maximum for titles.

handle # that has whitespace before it at the beginning of a line.

a comment only line is thought of as a blank line, not a missing line.

make sure *everything* can be backslash quoted, including {} in code blocks.

make sidebarblock etc better name.

make infinite loop protection.

learn proper difference between span and div.
--> div includes paragraph breaks as well.

do at least some replacements in code - things like dashes, ampersands etc,
that are required for html.

# marks in highlighting are *not* comments for jemdoc, they're comments for the highlighting.
--> enable comments in code blocks, somehow?

have to fix (jacobm@

syntax highlighting runs out on +this is

a sentence +. what happens?

characters hidden in {} will confuse vim syntax highlighting.

headers inside blocks should be coloured differently.

links should just be [link-target.html link name], which is better than having to check (jem@jaboc.net[jacob]). Simply skip the link name if you want to! perfect.

list continuation (multi-line lists)

add $monospace on steroids$ which does no in-text replacements.

fix wrapping when lines start with .s.

way of bypassing ellipses.
--> simply have \... which will bypass the first one and then the entire thing
- quite nice and natural.
