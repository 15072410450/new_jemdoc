jemdoc is a light text-based markup language designed for creating websites. It
takes a text file written with jemdoc markup, an optional configuration file and
an optional menu file, and makes static websites that look something like
http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/.

It was firstly written by Jacob Mattingley, in 2007. Much more info at http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/.
