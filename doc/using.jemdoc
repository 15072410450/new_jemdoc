# jemdoc: menu{MENU}{using.html}
= jemdoc: using

Type in your file, put jemdoc in your path somewhere, make sure
[http://www.python.org/ Python] is installed, and 

~~~
{}{}
jemdoc index.jemdoc
~~~

This will use a default configuration for the html elements, and create an
+index.html+. You can also use

~~~
{}{}
jemdoc -o html/index.html index.jemdoc
~~~

This will instead output to +html\/index.html+.

== Configuration
jemdoc has a built-in default configuration. This configuration includes the
particular html tags used when producing html. If you wish to adjust the html
that jemdoc produces, you can provide a configuration file to override the
built-in defaults.

For example, suppose you wanted to add [http://www.google.com/analytics/ Google
Analytics] tracking to your website. That requires adding a short section of
code before the +</body>+ tag.

First, find out which block needs to be changed by using

~~~
{}{}
jemdoc --show-config
~~~

This prints the default configuration. From this, the relevant configuration
block (the one which includes the +</body>+ tag) has a title +\[bodyend\]+, and
looks like

~~~
{}{}
[bodyend]
</body>
</html>
~~~

We create a new file +mysite.conf+, say, and put a new +\[bodyend\]+ block
inside it. The new file looks like this:

~~~
{}{}
[bodyend]
<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
_uacct = "UA-0000000-0";
urchinTracker();
</script>
</body>
</html>
~~~

To include the new configuration file, use the +-c+ option:

~~~
{}{}
jemdoc -c mysite.conf index.jemdoc
~~~

This will pull in the new +\[bodyend\]+ block from +mysite.conf+, but otherwise
work as before.

Options can be combined, as in
~~~
{}{}
jemdoc -c mysite.conf -o html/index.html index.jemdoc
~~~

This will use +mysite.conf+ and output to +html\/index.html+.
