and this trailing bit.
# could have a comment immediately after.

and then this text would still have to have a paragraph mark. # say, this is fun.
This is another line \# with a quoted comment.
I'm going to go ahead and quote some symbols: \", \+, \*, \=, \-.

You should email jem@jaboc.net[me] or someone@somewhere.com[]. You should visit
here.html[that site] or http://othersite.com[this site].

\. This is not a list.

\- And this isn't either. And this isn\'t a proper quote mark.

This would be a new paragraph here. This is a backslash \\ which is exciting.

=== Let's have some heading three action.
Here is heading three's magical text.

# this is a comment.

This should be /italics/ and *bold* and +monospace+.
It should be possible to have +i+/th/*s*.
- This is a list. Link to http://cvxmod.net[here].
- Another item.

This should also

- be a list, though
- there is a gap.
-- this is a sublist
-- with multiple
-- items
- this is back to level one
--- and now we jump to level 3
--- and stay here
-- and drop to level two
- and back to one
