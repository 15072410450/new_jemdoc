- Another item.

This should also

- be a list, though
- there is a gap.
-- this is a sublist
-- with multiple
-- items
- this is back to level one
--- and now we jump to level 3
--- and stay here
-- and drop to level two
- and back to one

. be a numbered list, though
.. this is a sublist
.. with multiple
.. items
. this is back to level one
.. and now we jump to level 2
... and to level three
... and hold
